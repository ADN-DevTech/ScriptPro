            <h2>Plugin of the Month, November 2010. Brought to you by the Autodesk Developer Network</h2>
            <h2>ScriptPro 2.0</h2>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>ScriptPro 2.0 is a batch processing utility that allows you to applya set of commands to multiple
                drawings. Simply specify a script filethat contains the commands you want to run on a single drawing,
                andthen use ScriptPro 2.0 to apply that script to as many drawings asyou like. ScriptPro 2.0 will handle
                opening and closing each drawingfor you. ScriptPro 2.0 takes AutoCAD scripting to a new level withan
                easy-to-use interface, logging, reusable project files and robusterror recovery so your processing
                continues even when AutoCAD can't.</p>
            <p>This version of ScriptPro is a ground-up rewrite of this highlypopular utility for AutoCAD. It has been
                redeveloped with the keyfeature of being usable on 64-bit systems, and is now being providedwith full
                source code for others to use and extend.</p>
            <h3>System Requirements</h3>
            <p>This application has been tested with AutoCAD 2008 onwards. It willuse the version of AutoCAD most
                recently used on the system. Toselect a particular version of AutoCAD for use with the tool, simplystart
                and close that version prior to using it.</p>
            <p>A pre-built version of the application has been provided which shouldwork on 32- and 64-bit Windows
                systems. The application requires the.NET Framework 3.5 or above.</p>
            <p>The application has not been tested with all AutoCAD-based products,but should work (see Feedback, below,
                otherwise).</p>
            <p>The source code has been provided as a Visual Studio 2008 projectcontaining C# code (not required to run
                the tool).</p>
            <p>This application makes use of Microsoft Ribbon for WPF October 2010. This only needs to be installed if
                you wish to work with the source project: <a

            </p>
            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>Copy the contents of the bin folder (the main application file,ScriptPro.exe and its supporting DLLs,
                DrawingListUC.dll,Microsoft.Windows.Shell.dll and RibbonControlsLibrary.dll)to the same location on your
                local system. Optionally copy thisReadMe to the same folder or the folder above.</p>
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>ScriptPro 2.0 is a batch-processing tool that will run an AutoCADscript on each drawing in a list of
                drawing files. Before you beginusing ScriptPro 2.0, you should have a specific task in mind.</p>
            <p>It can be as simple or as complex as you like. Once you have decidedon your task and have written a
                script to handle it, you decide whichdrawings you would like to run the script with.</p>
            <p>In the ScriptPro 2.0 Project Editor, you can specify the script fileto use and select the drawings to
                apply the script to. Thisinformation can be saved as a ScriptPro 2.0 project file.</p>
            <p>While running a project, ScriptPro 2.0 opens each drawing in sequenceand runs the associated script file.
            </p>
            <p>The following topics outline each of the steps for creating andrunning a ScriptPro 2.0 project.</p>
            <p>Starting ScriptPro</p>
            <p>ScriptPro 2.0 is a stand-alone application that runs independently ofAutoCAD. To simplify running the
                tool, you can create a shortcut toScriptPro.exe on your desktop. Otherwise simply run the
                executabledirectly from Windows Explorer or a command-prompt window.</p>
            <p>ScriptPro 2.0 has a ribbon UI. The ribbon has a number of differentgroups. They are List, Drawing Files,
                Run, Stop, Optionsand Help.</p>
            <h4>List:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>New - Creates a new ScriptPro 2.0 project.</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Load SCP Project</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reads the specified ScriptPro (SCP) project file.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Drawing Files:</h4>
            <p>Add - Adds drawing files (DWG &amp; DXF) to the current project.Add From Folder - Adds drawing files (DWG
                &amp; DXF) from a selected folder. to the current projectRemove - Removes the selected files from the
                current project.Check/Uncheck - Allows drawing files to be skipped during processing.</p>

                <li>Selected - Runs the selected script on all the selected drawing files in the current project.</li>
                <li>Failed - Re-runs the selected script on all the drawing files which previously failed to execute.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Stop:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Stop - Stops the processing of drawings.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Options:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Settings - Shows the Options dialog box which allows you to specify various options such as
                            the time-out period, log file path and initial script.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Help:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Help - Shows this ReadMe.txt file, if either placed in the same folder as ScriptPro.exe or the
                    parent folder.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Options dialog box contains a number of project-relatedsettings:</p>
            <h4>Process timeout per drawing in seconds</h4>
            <p>A timeout period indicating how long AutoCAD is inactive beforeScriptPro 2.0 aborts processing on the
                current drawing and moveson to the next drawing in the list. The time-out period is specifiedin seconds.
                If you are processing very large drawings, you may needto increase the time-out period to allow AutoCAD
                enough time to openthese drawings.</p>
            <h4>Restart AutoCAD after _ drawings</h4>
            <p>This indicates the number of drawings to process prior to restartingAutoCAD. Processing multiple drawings
                in the same AutoCAD sessionreduces the time needed to process them - as the application does notneed to
                be restarted - but typically leads to a gradual increase inmemory consumption. This option tells
                ScriptPro 2.0 to restartAutoCAD after processing a certain number of drawings, resetting thememory
                needed by the AutoCAD process.</p>
            <h4>AutoCAD startup script file</h4>
            <p>A script to be executed once when starting a new AutoCAD session.This can be used to load required LISP,
                ObjectARX, .NET or VBAapplications, for instance.</p>
            <h4>Process log folder</h4>
            <p>The location in which logs will be created. Each log will be named using the format
                <code>SPlog_date_hour_min_seconds.log</code> (e.g. SPlog_20_14_23_49.log) while running unsaved drawing
                list. In case of running drawing list, the name of log file will include the drawing list name with date
                time. A detailed log containing the text from AutoCAD's command-line will also be created using the
                format <code>SPlog_Detail_log_date_hour_min_seconds.log</code> (for unsaved drawing list) and
                <code>Drawinglistname_Detail_log_date_hour_min_seconds.log</code> .
            </p>
            <h4>Create image before closing the drawing file</h4>
            <p>Causes a screenshot to be captured of the AutoCAD application window,whether for all processed drawings
                or only the ones that have failed.</p>
            <h4>Select DWG/DXF files in sub directories</h4>
            <p>Causes the Add From Folder command to search sub-folders whenpopulating the list of drawings to process.
            </p>
            <h4>Run the tool in diagnostic mode</h4>
            <p>Causes processing to stop just before closing each drawing for theuser to verify the state of the drawing
                file. There is no timeoutduring this mode of running.</p>
            <h4>Delay during process (Seconds)</h4>
            <p>Delay setting which enables the user to slow down the tool, which in turnsgives enough time to AutoCAD to
                respond to the tools commands</p>
            <h4>AutoCAD exe path to use</h4>
            <p>This option allows the selection of particular AutoCAD version to be used with the tool. If no path is
                given, tool will use most recently used AutoCAD version on the system.</p>
            <h4>Run script without opening drawing file</h4>
            <p>Causes the script to run on empty/dummy document. Use this option when script file has commands to open
                and close the drawing. This option is helpful for commands likeRecover which requires the script open
                the file. The Drawing list selected in the UIis used to resolve the keywords in run time. This below
                example shows the script forperforming batch recover.</p>
            <p>Example 1:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    QAFLAGS 31
                    _RECOVER
                    &lt;acet:cfullfileName&gt;
                    _SAVEAS
                    2007(LT2007)
                    &lt;acet:cFolderName&gt;\&lt;acet:cBaseName&gt;_RECOVED.dwg
                    close
                </code>
            </pre>

            <h4>Command Line Access</h4>
            <p>To run a series of ScriptPro 2.0 projects from a DOS batch file,you can use the ScriptPro command line
                interface:</p>
            <p><code>&lt;install dir&gt;\ScriptPro &lt;project name&gt; run</code></p>
            <p>For example: <code>C:\\ScriptPro 2.0\\ScriptPro.exe c:\\TestProject.bpl run</code></p>
            <p>You can also use exit at the end to make silent exit of ScriptPro after processing the drawing list.</p>
            <p>For example:`C:\ScriptPro 2.0\ScriptPro.exe c:\TestProject.bpl run exit</p>
            <h4>ScriptPro Keywords</h4>
            <p>Keywords can be used to specify the current file name and its directory. When ScriptPro runs, it will
                replace each keyword with the correct value before processing the script. This is done for each drawing
                file after it has been opened so that the keywords are always replaced with the correct values from the
                current drawing.</p>
            <figure>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Keyword</th>
                            <th>Description</th>
                        </tr>

                            <td>Specifies the drawing file folder name (directory name)</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><a href="acet:cBaseName" target="_blank">acet:cBaseName</a></td>
                            <td>Specifies the base file name without a directory or extension</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><a href="acet:cExtension" target="_blank">acet:cExtension</a></td>
                            <td>Specifies the extension for the drawing file (.dwg, .dwt, or .dxf)</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><a href="acet:cFileName" target="_blank">acet:cFileName</a></td>
                            <td>Specifies the base name with the extension.<br />This will have the same value as the
                                DWGNAME system variable.</td>
                        </tr>

                            <td>Specifies the full file name with path and extension. <br />Call Script files</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </figure>
            <p>AutoCAD terminates the current script when a SCRIPT command is invoked. If you wish to call another
                script from the current one and continue processing from the current script once the called script
                process has completed, you can use the ScriptPro CALL command.The CALL command prompts for the script
                file to be called.</p>
            <p>For example:&nbsp;</p>
            <pre>
            <code>                
                zoom e
                call save.scr
            </code>
           </pre>
            <p>ScriptPro preprocesses scripts before running them. During this process, it finds all instances of CALL
                and replaces them with the actual script code from the called script. The resulting script file contains
                all the code from the original script and all the code from the called scripts. This file is placed in
                the temporary directory and is used when running the project.</p>
            <h4>Creating Scripts for ScriptPro</h4>
            <p>A script is a series of AutoCAD commands in a text file that can beused to carry out a task. With
                scripts, you can run several commandsin succession. You create script files outside AutoCAD, using a
                texteditor (such as Microsoft Windows Notepad) or a word processor (suchas Microsoft Word) that saves
                the file in ASCII format. The fileextension must be .scr. All references to long file names thatcontain
                embedded spaces must be enclosed in double quotes. Forexample, to insert the drawing c:\My Project
                Files\sink.dwg from ascript, you must use the following syntax:</p>
            <pre><code>-insert c:\My Project Files\sink.dwg</code></pre>
            <p>Script files can contain comments. Any line that begins with asemicolon (;) is considered a comment, and
                AutoCAD ignores the linewhile processing the script file. For information about creatingscripts, see the
                Customization Guide.</p>
            <p>When putting together a script for use with ScriptPro 2.0, you needto consider the actions you want
                performed on the drawing. ScriptPro2.0 will handle opening the drawing file and exiting the file
                onceprocessing is complete. ScriptPro 2.0 will not save the drawingautomatically. If you want the
                drawing saved, you must put thatinto your script.</p>
            <p>ScriptPro 2.0 preprocesses scripts before running them. During thisprocess, it finds all instances of
                CALL and replaces them with theactual script code from the called script. The resulting script
                filecontains all the code from the original script and all the code fromthe called scripts. This file is
                placed in the temporary directoryand is used when running the project.</p>
            <p>ScriptPro 2.0 comes with some sample files to help you get started.The files are contained in the Samples
                sub-folder.</p>
